This project highlights the text layer and OCR in pdf files and compares them.

## What is OCR?

Literally, OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It is a widespread technology to recognize text inside images, such as scanned documents and photos. OCR technology is used to convert virtually any kind of image containing written text (typed, handwritten, or printed) into machine-readable text data.

## What is it for?

This happens quite often, we want to understand whether OCR is needed or whether it is enough to use a text layer
The problem is that OCR is slow, so we don't want to use OCR on the whole document, but only part of it.
