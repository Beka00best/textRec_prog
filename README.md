This project highlights the text layer and OCR in pdf files and compares them.

## What is OCR?

Literally, OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It is a widespread technology to recognize text inside images, such as scanned documents and photos. OCR technology is used to convert virtually any kind of image containing written text (typed, handwritten, or printed) into machine-readable text data.

## What is it for?

This happens quite often, we want to understand whether OCR is needed or whether it is enough to use a text layer
The problem is that OCR is slow, so we don't want to use OCR on the whole document, but only part of it.

## Stages:
1. Select text using ocr
2. Select a text layer
3. Compare them (try to match and output mismatched strings) is the minimum
4. Write the launch instructions, put everything on github
5. Learn how to display diff beautifully 
6. Wrap it all in a web service
7. Learn how to pack it all in a container
